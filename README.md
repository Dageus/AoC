# Dageus' Advent of Code

I decided to start journaling my Advent of Code experience.

So have fun reading my solutions. Not all days are completed due to tight project deadlines (and I forgot to pick up the days I left behind)

## Solutions

### 2024

At the time I was learning Go, so I decided to code AoC entirely in Go (despite forgetting to do some day)

See [2024](./2024/)

### 2025

This time, I'm going to try to get into Rust, while mixing Go to just get into the "AoC mindset"

See [2025](./2025/)
